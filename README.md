# Kaggle Survey 2023 Dashboard Project

This repository contains a comprehensive dashboard created as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project**. The dashboard visualizes key insights from the Kaggle Survey 2023 data using **IBM Cognos Analytics** and **Google Looker Studio**.

## Dashboard Components

The dashboard is organized into three main tabs:

### A. Current Technology Usage

1. **Top 10 Programming Languages**
   - Visualizes the top 10 programming languages respondents have worked with (`LanguageHaveWorkedWith`).

2. **Top 10 Databases**
   - Visualizes the top 10 databases respondents have worked with (`DatabaseHaveWorkedWith`).

3. **Platforms**
   - Visualizes the different platforms respondents have worked with (`PlatformHaveWorkedWith`).

4. **Top 10 Web Frameworks**
   - Visualizes the top 10 web frameworks respondents have worked with (`WebframeHaveWorkedWith`).

### B. Future Technology Trends

1. **Top 10 Desired Programming Languages for Next Year**
   - Visualizes the top 10 programming languages respondents wish to learn next year (`LanguageWantToWorkWith`).

2. **Top 10 Desired Databases for Next Year**
   - Visualizes the top 10 databases respondents wish to learn next year (`DatabaseWantToWorkWith`).

3. **Desired Platforms for Next Year**
   - Visualizes the platforms respondents wish to work with next year (`PlatformWantToWorkWith`).

4. **Top 10 Desired Web Frameworks for Next Year**
   - Visualizes the top 10 web frameworks respondents wish to learn next year (`WebframeWantToWorkWith`).

### C. Demographics

1. **Respondents by Gender**
   - Visualizes the number of respondents classified by gender (`Gender`).

2. **Respondents by Country**
   - Visualizes the number of respondents from different countries (`Country`).

3. **Respondents by Age Group**
   - Visualizes the number of respondents in different age groups (`Age`).

4. **Respondents by Gender and Education Level**
   - Visualizes the respondents classified by gender (`Gender`) and further categorized by their education level (`EdLevel`).
